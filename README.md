Photos of animals delivered straight to your phone -- via Twilio's MMS platform

### Installation
Check out the [MMS Messaging Guide](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/09/getting-started-with-twilio-mms.html) for tips on how to set up a Twilio MMS application with Python and Flask. The Animal Messenger app has the same dependencies and can be dropped into the same environment without any reconfiguration.

### Usage
Send a text message to your trusty Twilio phone number and mention a "cat", 'dog", or "emu". The Animal Messenger app will respond to your text with a picture message of that animal.

### Notes
This app will only send one animal picture per request, although the service can support up to 10 images per message.
